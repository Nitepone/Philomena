<div class="subcontent paragraph">
  <p>
	I work as a Software Engineer with a broad range of experience from: OS
	kernel development; full-stack web design; computer vision; and even devops.
	Deeply invested in my work, I strive to acquire a full understanding of any
	system I work with. The desire to understand how things work has fuelled my
	ambitions since I was a child. From my childhood wonders "how does a mouse work", I
	spent my time at RIT pushing my limits. While getting a bachelors in
	Software Engineering, I got a minor in Computing Security. I additionally
	managed to accidentally get a minor in Computer Science while taking random
	classes that interested me. [Operating Systems, Computer Graphics, and Computer Vision]

	My skills in devops have been instrumental while I have studied. From my projects, I am confident with
	the following:
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li> Configuring build systems from scratch </li>
		<li> Continuous integration for building, testing, and code formatting </li>
		<li> Advanced git usage and management (submodules, rebasing, detached head, scripting) </li>
		<li> Linux server management (Nginx, Systemd, Docker, dpkg/rpm) </li>
	</ul>
  <p>
	Additionally, many of my projects utilize object oriented design.
	I have had a major engagement in system architecture discussions during my
	projects and have worked to incorporate OOD principles into Java, Python, and even C

	Embedded Linux development was my primary focus while working at D3 Engineering.
	While working there, I found myself working directly on customer projects, often
	with a customer facing presense. My projects had me working with bleeding edge
	Nvidia Jetson hardware. The deliverables for these projects were drivers for
	freshly designed custom baseboards. This work would occassionally require me
	to work with hardware engineers to debug PCB designs.

	While working as a free lance web developer during my early college career, I
	learned the importance of communication. From professionalism to managing
	project requirements and deadlines, communication is something I see as a
	vital component of software engineering.
