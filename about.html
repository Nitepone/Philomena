  <h1>About Me</h1>
</div>

<div class="subcontent paragraph">
  <p>My name is Tyler Hart and I am a Software Engineer with interests in
  Linux Development. I am currently studying at Rochester Institute of
  Technology. When I am not doing assignments for my courses, I tend to study
  Unix systems and ways to improve my workflow. I find my greatest interest in
  low level languages like C and Rust but am perfectly capable with the
  features of higher lever abstract languages like Java, Python, and PHP.</p>

<div class="subcontent paragraph">
  <p>I have been maintaining Linux servers since I hid a laptop motherboard in
  my dresser as my first server in middle school. Today I find myself with
  multiple servers, and now use Linux on my laptop for all my development work.
  I feel committed to free and open source software, and seek to offer my hand
  at contributing to FOSS projects. I strongly believe that all mission
  critical code should be open sourced so that we can all benefit from well
  vetted code, and save our self from writing the same thing over and over
  again.</p>
