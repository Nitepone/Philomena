  <h1>About Me</h1>
</div>

<div class="subcontent paragraph">
  <p>
	I work as a Software Engineer with a broad range of experience from: OS
	kernel development; full-stack web design; computer vision; and devops system
	administration.  I strive to acquire a full understanding of any system I
	work with. The desire to understand how things work has fuelled my ambitions
	since I was a child. From my origins of childhood wonders "how does a mouse
	work", I ended up studying at Rochester Institute of Technology. While
	getting a bachelors in Software Engineering, I got minors in Computing
	Security and Computer Science. The Computer Science minor allowed me to study
	CS classes that interest me: Operating Systems, Computer Graphics, and
	Computer Vision.

	<h2>My Studies</h2>
  <p>
	During my studies, I gathered skills with Object Oriented Design and extensive
	experience with multiple programming languages including: C, Python, Java, and Javascript.
	</p>
  <p>
	My skills in devops have been instrumental for collaborative projects. From
	my projects, I am confident with the following: </p>
	<ul>
		<li> Configuring build systems from scratch </li>
		<li> Continuous integration for building, testing, and code formatting </li>
		<li> Advanced git usage and management (submodules, rebasing, detached head,
				 hook scripting) </li>
		<li> Linux server management (Nginx, Systemd, Docker, dpkg/rpm) </li>
	</ul>

	<h2>Work Experience</h2>
  <p>
	Embedded Linux development was my primary focus while working at D3
	Engineering.  While working there, I found myself working directly on
	customer projects, often with a customer facing presense. My projects had me
	working with bleeding edge Nvidia Jetson hardware. The deliverables for these
	projects were drivers for freshly designed custom baseboards. This work would
	occassionally require me to work with hardware engineers to debug PCB
	designs.

  <p>
	While working as a freelance web developer during my early college career.
	This was an excellent exercise in my ability to manage projects. I managed
	my own projects from proposals to deliverables and everything in between.
