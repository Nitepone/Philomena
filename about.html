  <h1>About Me</h1>

<div class="subcontent paragraph">
  <p>My name is Tyler Hart and I am a Software Engineer with interests in Linux Development. I am currently studying at Rochester Institute of Technology. When I am not doing assignments for my courses, I tend to study Unix systems and ways to improve my workflow. I also work on my skills with programming languages not covered in my courses such as Rust.</p>

<div"subcontent paragraph">
<p>I have been maintaining Linux servers since I first started hosting Minecraft servers back in middle school and look to continue to find ways to live as a CLI warrior. That said, I find great pride in finding the most efficient solution to problems, and trying to to rely on dirty bodges to hold things together. My primary focuses right now are on low level languages such as C, C++ and Rust. I am comfortable working with Java and Python, and will often use Python for quick personal projects.</p>
