  <h2>DeerCV</h2>
  <p>
  My senior project in computer vision. DeerCV aims to identify individual deer of a population.
  This is a project in progress, but we are currently utilising YOLOv5, Deeplabcut, and
  custom pre processing to extract features from the visual appearance of a deer for identification.

  <h2>Tetris Mint</h2>
  <p>
  Another Tetris clone. Written in C, utilizing curses, and with support for networked play.
  Has builds for Windows and Linux that are very resource efficient.
  All with pretty continuous integration and packaged up for Debian and Windows.

  <h2>D3 Engineering Nvidia BSP</h2>
  <p>
  Kernel drivers, device trees, and bash scripts. I worked on this codebase from 2019 to 2021 while
  working at D3 Engineering. My primary contributions include: the modular device tree structure;
  kernel drivers such as `nxc-fpga-gpio.c` and `overlay-loader.c`; and many user facing bash scripts
  such as `d3-install-dtb` and `d3-select-cameras-boot`. D3 kindly offers it's primary branch on Github
  in compliance with the GPL.

  <h2>My Website (Philomena)</h2>
  <p>
  A simple website, nothing really that exciting. Self hosted. Few dependencies. Hopefully it will
  render well on whatever device you please.

  <h2>Abotimable</h2>
  <p>
  We designed a chatbot to annoy people. This was done as part of Dandyhacks in 2018 as a team of 4.
  We deployed it on the Dandyhacks Slack during our presentation.
